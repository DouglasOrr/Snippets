# HandicappedRps

A tiny bit of code playing around with the trivial Rock-Paper-Scissors game.
What isn't quite so trivial is the problem of optimal strategy when one player is forced to do Rock at least half the time.
Clearly you should be able to beat a player with such a handicap, on average, but how & by how much?
